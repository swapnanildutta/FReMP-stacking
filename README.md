# FReMP-stacking

**This is my first attempt at making a FReMP stack, functional and somewhat presentable web application.**

`The FReMP stack is a highly scalable full stack framework, which can be used to build awesome web apps. The acronym stands for Flask, ReactJS, Mongodb and Python. Unlike other famous stacks such as MEAN and MERN, the FReMP stack uses Python to handle back-end operations. Examples of such operations can be machine learning and artificial intelligence operations, web scraping tools or digital image processing.`
